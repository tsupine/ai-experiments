This notebook explores linear algebra in context of machine learning, specificially in word-vectors (natural language processing) and image recognition. I specifically utilize PCA and other matrix operations that make these models possible. My first model predicts countries that correspond to the capital cities (spacy data) and second model classifies handwritten digits in a simple nerual network (MNIST data).
